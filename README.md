# D3drugdata
D3 visualization of drug repurposing for Alzheimer

## Overview:

The goal of this project is to identify existing drugs that can be repurposed for Alzheimerâ€™s Disease treatment based on 
genomic data analysis. As the final output, the drug data are stored in tree structure. I use D3 to
practice my data visualization skill.

## data and code discription:

The json file stores the drug data with three levels tree structure. 
* 1st level: the root of the tree is Drug for Alzheimer's Disease (AD);
* 2nd level: drugs targeting causal genes; APOE and CCL11 are two causal genes for AD that I found in my GWAS study.
* 3nd level: The drugs information collected from research literature and online drug database.

drug_datavisual.html is the Javascript code I implement the bubble figure to visualize the drug data. 
[The bubble figure](https://luplatina.github.io/D3drugdata/bubble_datavisual.html) shows the hierachical structure of the drug data and also allow the user to see the state of the drugs in their development timeline.
